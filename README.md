# Arduino---pressure-sensor-status-duration
A small program that prints the collective duration of a pressure sensor under a defined pressure value.

PHYSICAL ASSETS:

Arduino UNO R3 board

Resistance 10kΩ *1

Breadboard

FSR402 sensor

USB 2.0 cable

Dupont Line * 5


SETUP:

Dupont Line 1：(5v on UNO board) to (left + row 1 on breadboard)

Dupont Line 2：(GND on UNO board) to (left - row 1 on breadboard)

Dupont Line 3：(A0 on UNO board) to (a22 on breadboard)

Dupont Line 4：(left - row 17 on breadboard) to (a17 on breadboard)

Dupont Line 5：(left + row 22 on breadboard) to (a23 on breadboard)

Resistance 10kΩ: (d17) to (d22)

FSR402 sensor: (e22) to (e23)
